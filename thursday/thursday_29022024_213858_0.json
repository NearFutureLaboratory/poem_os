    "poem": "On this fine Thursday, I must confess,\nMy socks don\u2019t match and my room's a mess.\nI woke with a start, the week half done,\nWondering where the other days had gone.\n\nMonday waved goodbye, Tuesday tip-toed by,\nWednesday winked at me, yet here am I.\nOn a day that\u2019s neither here nor there,\nStuck smack in the middle, gasping for air.\n\nThursday! Ah, Thursday, you peculiar day,\nNot close enough to Monday to cause dismay,\nNor near enough to Friday to cheer,\nJust a merry reminder that the weekend's near.\n\nThursday is like a cup of tea, half drunk,\nOr a melody, half hummed, semi-funked.\nA book half-read, a song half-sung,\nThe climb nearly finished, but the bell not yet rung.\n\nSo here's to Thursday, and its quirky grace,\nTo its awkward spot, in time and space.\nLet's raise our mugs to its odd little charm,\nHoping the weekend comes, without any alarm.\n\nMay our Thursday pass quickly, our spirits stay high,\nMay our laughter fill rooms, reaching the sky.\nFor Thursday, dear Thursday, you\u2019re a friend true and through,\nA reminder that, soon, we'll bid work adieu.",
