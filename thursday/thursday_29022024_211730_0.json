    "poem": "Ode to Thursday, the Forgotten Middle Child\n\nIn the weekly family portrait, Thursday\u2019s hardly ever styled,\nSquished between the hump day Wednesday and the Friday oh-so-wiled.\nAn awkward middle child it is, its glamour somewhat mild,\nYet without it, our desperate march to weekends would be wild.\n\nMonday dumps its gloom and doom, a sentiment reviled,\nTuesday tries to lift the mood, but its efforts are defiled.\nWednesday tells us \"halfway there,\" its optimism compiled,\nBut Thursday whispers softly, \"I\u2019m the path less reconciled.\"\n\nThursday, oh dear Thursday, you\u2019re peculiarly dialed,\nA mix of hope and weariness, emotions versatile.\nYou\u2019re the teaser of the weekend, your promise gently filed\nUnder \"Soon but not quite yet,\" a forecast versatile.\n\nWith ambitions slightly wilted, and energy beguiled,\nWe trudge through Thursday\u2019s hours, by routine mildly riled.\nBut in its subtle offering, adventure is compiled,\nFor Thursday nights hold magic, in quiet moments styled.\n\nPerhaps a quiet pint with friends, or books by fate compiled,\nThursday\u2019s charm is in the calm, in moments undefiled.\nNo raucous shouts or glaring lights, its beauty is not wild,\nBut in the peace of nearing rest, life\u2019s pressures reconciled.\n\nSo here\u2019s to you, dear Thursday, so unfairly exiled,\nThe bridge across the chasm, between the tame and wild.\nYour silent grace reminds us, though the week has been defiled,\nThat every day holds beauty, in its own way reconciled.\n\nLet\u2019s raise a glass to Thursday, in gratitude compiled,\nFor guiding us toward weekend dreams, by daily grind beguiled.\nYour subtle touch, a gentle nudge, our spirits reconciled,\nThursday, you\u2019re the unsung hero, in weekday terms, beguiled.",
