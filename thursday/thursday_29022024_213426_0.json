    "poem": "Oh Thursday, you cheeky midweek tease,\nWith the weekend in sight, yet you playfully freeze\nThe hands of the clock, so slowly they tick,\nMaking Friday feel like a century away \u2013 oh, slick!\n\nYou\u2019re neither here nor there, a bit of a jest,\nNot quite the start, nor the end, but doing your best.\nA mimic of Monday, with less of the glum,\nA prelude to Friday, with weekend\u2019s hum.\n\nThey say \u201clittle Friday,\u201d a hopeful moniker at best,\nA mini celebration, a weekday jest.\nWith one foot in labor and one in rest,\nWe\u2019re caught in your limbo, a peculiar test.\n\nThursday, you sly fox, you dress up so fine,\nIn promises of relaxation, soon to be mine.\nYet hours are spent dreaming, of what\u2019s to come,\nWhile tasks pile up, an ever-growing sum.\n\nYou're the weekly mirage, a trick of the light,\nPromising oasis, but out of sight.\nWe chase you with memes, and coffee in streams,\nCounting down hours, to weekend dreams.\n\nSo here\u2019s to you, Thursday, with your peculiar charm,\nYou keep us going, with less alarm.\nA beacon of hope, that the end is near,\nThank you, dear Thursday, for bringing us cheer.",
