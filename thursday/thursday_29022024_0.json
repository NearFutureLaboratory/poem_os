    "poem": "On a Thursday morn, I awoke, perplexed,\nTo a week that felt oddly hexed.\nMonday had me wishing for Friday's embrace,\nTuesday and Wednesday, a forgettable race.\n\nBut Thursday, oh Thursday, what are you about?\nYou're not the week's beginning, nor its way out.\nYou sit there smirking, almost the end,\nTeasing of weekend plans you pretend to amend.\n\n\"Last day of toil!\" you seem to decree,\nBut there's still Friday, between freedom and me.\nThursday, you're the week's cheeky tease,\nPromising ease but never quite to please.\n\nYou're the hope that the workweek is nearly done,\nYet remind us there's still quite a bit to be won.\nA prankster in time's relentless march,\nTiptoeing, chuckling, carrying a starched,\n\nCalendar page, marked with weekend dreams,\nYet stuck in a loop, or so it seems.\nThursday, let\u2019s make a jolly truce,\nYour humor found in this mild abuse.\n\nPerhaps you're not so dreary after all,\nWith Friday's promise in your beck and call.\nSo, here's to Thursday, the week's sly jester,\nWhose end-of-week tease makes the heart fester.\n\nYet in this playful, weekly charade,\nWe find a rhythm, masterfully played.\nThursday, we salute you, with a wink and a sigh,\nFor after you, the weekend cannot deny.",
