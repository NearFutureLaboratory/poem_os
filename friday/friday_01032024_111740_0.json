    "poem": "On Friday, my boss wears a grin so thin,\nWhispers, \u201cwork hard,\u201d but I know where he\u2019s been.\nOut the door at four, leaving tasks galore,\nI follow suit, can\u2019t bear it anymore.\n\nI leap into the evening, heart aflutter,\nPlans so grand, I can barely stutter.\nA weekend of fun, under the sun, or maybe none,\nLet\u2019s spin the tales, till Monday\u2019s tales come undone.\n\nSaturday morning, a mythical time,\nWhen sleep is sweet, and waking is a crime.\nBut brave the daylight, for adventures beckon,\nTill we find ourselves asking, \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday already? What the heckin\u2019?\u201d\n\nWe'll dance with the shadows, dine under the stars,\nLose our way, finding new scars.\nA warrior of weekend, in Monday\u2019s meeting light,\nBearing tales of a valorous, victorious fight.\n\nSo raise your cups, filled with coffee or tea,\nTo the weekend warriors we're all meant to be.\nLaugh at the to-do list, let's give it a spin,\nFor come Monday morning, we\u2019ll wear the boss's grin.",
