    "poem": "It's Friday, oh Friday, the week\u2019s grand finale,\nA break from the norm, an escape from the valley\nOf emails and meetings, that endless travail,\nWe're sailing away, let the weekend prevail!\n\nWith a wink and a smile, the sun greets the day,\nSaying, \u201cForget those reports, come out and play!\u201d\nSo I'm ditching the tie and the corporate drone,\nFor two days of freedom, oh how I have grown!\n\nI\u2019ve got plans with my couch, we\u2019re on a first-name basis,\nAnd a date with the fridge, to visit new places.\nPizza and I might take a trip to the moon,\nWith a fork as my guide, we\u2019ll be there by noon.\n\nThe remote and I, we'll go on adventures,\nThrough series and movies, no unturned ventures.\nI'll laugh, I'll might cry, in my cozy retreat,\nWith popcorn as my companion, my weekend\u2019s complete.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget, there\u2019s a world outside,\nWhere adventures await, far and wide.\nI might venture to where the wild wi-fis don\u2019t roam,\nOr just to the yard, a wild journey from home.\n\nI'll toast to my friends, both near and far,\nThrough screens or in person, at home or a bar.\nWe'll share tales of conquest, of beasts like \u201cThe Task,\u201d\nAnd don those great armors, known as \u201cThe Mask.\u201d\n\nAs Sunday sneaks up, with its subtle approach,\nI'll cherish these moments, beyond reproach.\nFor come Monday morning, with its glaring light,\nI'll recall these tales, in the deep of the night.\n\nSo here's to the weekend, in all its glory,\nA respite, a break, a two-day story.\nMay your coffee be strong, and your sleep be deep,\nFor soon we'll return, to the weekday heap!",
