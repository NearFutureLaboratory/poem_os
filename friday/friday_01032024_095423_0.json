    "poem": "In the realm of week's wide sea,  \nWhere Monday's blues doth heavily flee,  \nA beacon shines, oh so bright,  \nIt's Friday, my friends, the pure delight.  \n\n\"Why?\" you ask, with a curious grin,  \nDoes Friday bring such joy within?  \n\"Because,\" I say, with wit so sly,  \n\"On Fridays, even the calendar says 'W T F' is nigh!\"  \n\nSo cheers to Friday, our weekly prize,  \nFor after two more days, the cycle reprises.  \nBut worry not, for it\u2019s a token,  \nThe week's almost done, or so it\u2019s spoken.",
